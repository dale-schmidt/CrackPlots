<hr class="howToHr" />

<h3>Creating a Project</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>To create a new project, navigate to the <a href="/projects/index">Project Index</a> page. From there, click the Add Project button at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3>Editing your Project</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>Click on a project in the project index to open its edit page. This page allows you to edit information about the project at the top level as well as information about its corresponding acts. The numbered tabs allow you to scroll through the different acts.</p>
</div>
<hr class="howToHr" />

<h3>Editing Acts, Sequences and Scenes</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>To edit an act, navigate to the act you want to edit on the project edit page and click on the Edit Act button.</p>
    <img src="~/Assets/images/editActExample.jpg" />
    <p>This button takes you to the Act edit screen. Each act is divided into sequences (view the <a href="/home/faq">FAQ</a> for an explanation of sequence theory) and each sequence is divided into several scenes. You can add and delete sequences and scenes as it fits your project.</p>

<h3>Saving your Project</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>CrackPlots auto-saves your work every time you stop typing. When you see this icon in the top right corner, that means your latest changes have been saved.</p>

<h3>Adding Collaborators</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>To add collaborators to your project, your collaborator must also have a CrackPlots account. When they do, navigate to the project edit screen and click on Collaborators.</p>
    <img src="~/Assets/images/collaborators example.jpg" />
    <p>Enter the email address your collaborator used to sign up for CrackPlots in the field that appears and click Add. The project will then be added to their projects list so you can work on it together. You can add as many collaborators as you like. You and your collaborators can work on the project at the same time and the outline will auto-update on all of your devices for any changes any of you make. To remove a collaborator, simply click the minus sign next to their email address.</p>

<h3>Exporting your finished outline</h3>
<div class="faqAnswer">
    <p>To export your finished outline, navigate to the project edit screen and click on the Print View button.</p>
    <img src="~/Assets/images/printProjectExample.jpg" />
    <p>This will open your project in a page without the formatting, allowing you to easily print or save as a PDF.</p>
